 It has long been recognized that some disease can only be treated with knife. The history of surgery is as old as that of mankind and disease. Surgery has evolved from primitive live saving to very highly sophisticated form of technology. In many western countries surgery had been carried out by barbers in the past. Before the invention of antiseptics and anesthesia surgery had been very painful and risky.

Today about 234 million operations are being carried out every year. A rate of 0.4 to 0.8% death and 3 to 16% complication means that at least one million death and 7 million disabling complication each year. Surgical complications are common and often preventable.
